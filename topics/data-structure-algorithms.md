# Data structure and Algorithms

## Questions:
- #### What's a `Big O Notation`?
- #### What's a `Time Complexity`?
- #### What's a `Space Complexity`?
- #### What's a concept of `Dynamic Programming`?
- #### What's a concept of `Dizel i zwyciezaj`?
- #### What's a Stack?
- #### What a `Trie`?
- #### What's a `Heap`?
- #### How to get minimum value from `Minimum Heap`?

    Get first item from an array. Time complexity - O(1)

- #### What's a `Binary Search Tree`?

    It's a type of Tree Data Structure. Each node has maximum 2 children nodes, A value in the left child is less then value in root node, and value in right child is greater then value in root node. 

- #### How a `HashMap` works?
- #### How `Hashing` works?
- #### How to handle `collisions` in `HashMap`?
- #### What's a `Time complexity` to get object from a HashMap?

    Constant time - O(1).

- #### Describe a types of `Tree Traversals`

    inorder, preorder, postorder

- #### What's an `inorder traversal`?

    It's a way of traversing a tree, where: first left child , then current node, and right child.

- #### What's a `preorder traversal`?

    It's a way of traversing a tree, where: first current node, then left child, and right child.

- #### What's a `postorder traversal`?

    It's a way of traversing a tree, where: first left child , then right child, and current node.

- #### What's a `DFS`?
    Depth-first Search 

- #### What's a `BFS`? 
    Breadth-first search

- #### What a `data structure` is used to implement `DFS`?

    Stack - during traversal push/pop node from/to the stack

- #### What a `data structure` is used to implement `BFS`?

 
## Ideas to reslove Alghoritm or Data structure for problem:
- #### Find `Kth smallest element` from an Array
    Answer: Put all item to minimum `Heap` and the get first Kth elements
- #### Valid parenthesis
    Answer: Use a `Stack` to put all open parenthesis, and get close parenthesis.
