# Data structure and Algorithms

## Questions:
- #### `Big O Notation`
- #### `Time Complexity`
- #### `Space Complexity`
- #### Concept of `Dynamic Programming`
- #### Concept of `Dizel i zwyciezaj`
- #### Data structure: `Stack`
- #### Data structure: `Trie`
- #### Data structure: `Heap`
- #### How to get minimum value from `Minimum Heap`?

    Get first item from an array. Time complexity - O(1)

- #### Data structure: `Binary Search Tree`

    It's a type of Tree Data Structure. Each node has maximum 2 children nodes, A value in the left child is less then value in root node, and value in right child is greater then value in root node. 

- #### How a `HashMap` works?
- #### How `Hashing` works?
- #### Handling `collision` in `HashMap`
- #### `Time complexity` of getting object from HashMap

    Constant time - O(1).

- #### Describe a types of `Tree Traversals`

    inorder, preorder, postorder

- #### `Inorder traversal`

    It's a way of traversing a tree, where: first left child , then current node, and right child.

- #### `Preorder traversal`

    It's a way of traversing a tree, where: first current node, then left child, and right child.

- #### `Postorder traversal`

    It's a way of traversing a tree, where: first left child , then right child, and current node.

- #### `DFS` - Depth-first search
    Example

- #### `BFS` - Breadth-first search 
    Breadth-first search

- #### `data structure` to implement `DFS`?

    Stack - during traversal push/pop node from/to the stack

- #### `data structure` to implement `BFS`?

 
## Ideas to reslove Alghoritm or Data structure for problem:
- #### Find `Kth smallest element` from an Array
    Answer: Put all item to minimum `Heap` and the get first Kth elements
- #### Valid parenthesis
    Answer: Use a `Stack` to put all open parenthesis, and get close parenthesis.
