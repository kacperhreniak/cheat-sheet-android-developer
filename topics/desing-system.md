## Calculations
1 kB = 1000 B = 10^3 B
1 MB = 1000 kB = 10^6 B
1 GB = 1000 MB = 10^9 B
1 TB = 1000 GB = 10^12 B
1 PB = 1000 TB = 10^15 B
1 EB = 1000 PB = 10^18 B

### **Basic size:
1 char = 2B
1 average photo = 200 kB
1 good quality photo = 2 MB
1 minute of average quality movie = 3 MB
1 hour of average quality movie = 200 MB
1 minute of streaming = 50 MB

#### Movie store data
720p -> X MB
480p -> 1/2 of X MB
360p -> 1/4 of X MB
240p -> 1/8 of X MB
144p -> 1/16 of X MB
, so summary of all resolution could be estimated as 2X MB
