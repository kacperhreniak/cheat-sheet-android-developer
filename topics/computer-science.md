## OOP questions:
- #### What's a `pure function`? 

    **Pure Function** provides a result based only on arguments. There is no side effects, no state changes, so it could be run thousands, millions times with same result each time.

    **Kotlin language** has no extra support for pure functions. 

- #### What's a concept of `overriding methods`?

    **Overriding methods** is an OOP concept allowing to provide custom implementation of specific method by subclass or child class. A keyword override is also used for implementations of an interfaces.

    **Kotlin language** allows to provide default implementation strictlyÂ

## Architecture
- #### What's `Model` in architectures?

    Model layer provides data to the system. This layer consists of repositories, use cases. It isn't just a model as an object, but all classes provide this object. 

- #### What's `View` in architectures?

    View is a presentation layer. This layer consists of all classes connected to UI, View. For example on Android platform, the View part could be activity, fragment, xml file, method annotated as composable.

- #### What's `ViewModel` in MVVM architecture?


- #### What's `Presenter` in architectures?

- #### What's a `MVVM` architecture?

    Model, View, ViewModel

- #### What's a `MVP` architecture?

    Model, View, Presenter

- #### What's a `MVI` architecture?

    Model, View, Intent

- #### What's a `Redux` architecture?
- #### What's a `SOLID` principle?

## Protocols
- #### What's a `HTTP protocol`?
- #### What's a `TCP protocol`?
- #### What's a `UDP protocol`?
