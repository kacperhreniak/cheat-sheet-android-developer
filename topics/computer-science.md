## OOP questions:
- #### What's a `pure function`? 

    **Pure Function** provides a result based only on arguments. There is no side effects, no state changes, so it could be run thousands, millions times with same result each time.

    **Kotlin language** has no extra support for pure functions. 

- #### What's a concept of `overriding methods`?

    **Overriding methods** is an OOP concept allowing to provide custom implementation of specific method by subclass or child class. A keyword override is also used for implementations of an interfaces.

    **Kotlin language** allows to provide default implementation strictlyÂ
