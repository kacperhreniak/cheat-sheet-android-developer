# Computer Science
## OOP questions:
- #### `Pure` function 

    **Pure Function** provides a result based only on arguments. There is no side effects, no state changes, so it could be run thousands, millions times with same result each time.

    **Kotlin language** has no extra support for pure functions. 

- #### `Overriding methods`

    **Overriding methods** is an OOP concept allowing to provide custom implementation of specific method by subclass or child class. A keyword override is also used for implementations of an interfaces.

    **Kotlin language** allows to provide default implementation strictly 

- #### `Overloading methods` 
- #### `Operator overlading` 
- #### `Composition` approach

    Fundamental concept of OOP describes class wirh the references to other objects. Sometimes compositions is the only way to extend final class from external library. Compositions allows to add new features or expand class.

- #### `Inheritence` approach

    Fundamental concept of OOP, it allows to inherit class to provide extended features or override methods from base class. To use inheritance class has to be open or abstract.

- #### `Abstraction` concept

    Additional layer is a concept of hidding specific implementations and allows to impelment code based only on general interfaces. Abstraction focuses on is a great concept to design features and focus on what should be done. Mostly implement by interfaces.

- #### `Encapsulation` concept

    Encapsulation is a concept to hide data, by control an access to the properties by visible modifiers. Property aren't easily achievable insted of it are hidden by the getter and setters. Encapsulation is more focused on: how should be done.

- #### `equals()`

    One of the basic methods from class Any in złotlin. Used to compare two objectes. equals() methods should be compatible with hashCode() method. data class generates implementation of equals method basing on parameters in a constructor.

- #### `hashCode()`

## Backend JVM questions:
- #### How`JVM` works
- #### `Garbage collector`?
- #### `Memory leak`?
- #### `LRU` cache?
- #### `Thread`?
- #### `Process`?

## Concepts
- #### `Dependecy Injection` pattern?
- #### `Service Locator` pattern?
- #### `Continous Integration`?
- #### `Continous Delivery`?
- #### `Mocking` / `Mock`?
- #### `concurency`? 

- #### `Consistency`?
- #### `Latency`?
- #### `Rest`?
- #### `HTTP protocol`?
- #### `Microservices architecture`?
- #### `Load Balacing`?
- #### `DNS`?
- #### `Bandwidth`?
- #### `Percentile`?
- #### Code group 200 HTTP status 
- #### Code group 300 HTTP status code group 
- #### Code group 400 HTTP status code group 
- #### Code group 500 HTTP status code group 

## Security:
- #### `SSL pining`
- #### `JWT Token`
- #### `OAuth`
- #### `refresh token`
- #### `access token`
 
## Architecture
- #### `Model` in architectures

    Model layer provides data to the system. This layer consists of repositories, use cases. It isn't just a model as an object, but all classes provide this object. 

- #### `View` in architectures

    View is a presentation layer. This layer consists of all classes connected to UI, View. For example on Android platform, the View part could be activity, fragment, xml file, method annotated as composable.

- #### `ViewModel` in MVVM architecture


- #### `Presenter` in architecture

- #### `MVVM` architecture

    Model, View, ViewModel

- #### `MVP` architecture

    Model, View, Presenter

- #### `MVI` architecture

    Model, View, Intent

- #### `Redux` architecture
- #### `SOLID` principle

## Protocols
- #### `HTTP protocol`
- #### `TCP protocol`
- #### `UDP protocol`

## Code example

## Design system
- #### Basic size of files
- #### (Dis)Advetages of SQL
- #### (Dis)Advetages of NoSQL 
- #### Estimate data usage
- #### Estimate storage
